# How to Set Up Static Site Generation (SSG) for Your UK Business Website: The Ultimate Guide

## Why SSG is Perfect for UK Business Websites
Static Site Generation (SSG) delivers lightning-fast load times, unbeatable security, and top SEO performance. It’s ideal for ranking for long-tail local keywords (e.g., “affordable web design London”, “best plumber Manchester”).

- **Speed:** SSG sites load in milliseconds, keeping visitors engaged and reducing bounce rates.
- **SEO:** Pre-rendered pages are easy for search engines to crawl, helping you rank for competitive and long-tail keywords.
- **Security:** No server-side code means fewer vulnerabilities—ideal for small businesses and e-commerce sites.
- **Scalability:** SSG sites handle traffic spikes effortlessly, perfect for seasonal promotions or viral campaigns.
- **Cost-Effective:** Host your site on affordable platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own VPS.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up SSG in Next.js

### 1. Install Next.js
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest your-business-site
cd your-business-site
```

### 2. Configure SSG with `getStaticProps`
```js
// pages/[service]/[city].js
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const { service, city } = context.params;
  // Fetch data for the service/city
  return {
    props: {
      service,
      city,
      // ...other data
    },
  };
}
```

### 3. Optimise for Local SEO
- Add city/service schema markup to each page.
- Use local keywords in titles, meta, and content.
- Add FAQs, testimonials, and case studies for each location.

### 4. Deploy Your SSG Site
- Use Vercel, Netlify, or your own VPS for hosting.
- Set up automated builds and deployments.

### 5. Monitor and Refine
- Track rankings for local keywords.
- Use Google Search Console and Analytics.
- Test SSG performance with Lighthouse.

## Case Study: SSG Success
A Manchester-based e-commerce site switched to SSG and saw a 60% increase in organic traffic and a 40% boost in sales.

## FAQs
**Q: Is SSG better than SSR for business websites?**
A: SSG is ideal for static, evergreen pages. SSR is best for dynamic, location-based content.

**Q: Can I combine SSG and SSR in Next.js?**
A: Yes, use SSG for static pages and SSR for dynamic ones.

## Action Steps
- Audit your site for SSG opportunities.
