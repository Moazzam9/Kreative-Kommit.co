# The Ultimate Technical Guide to Schema Markup for UK Local Businesses

## Why Schema Markup Matters
Schema markup is structured data (usually JSON-LD) that helps search engines understand your business, enabling rich results like reviews, hours, and local info. It’s essential for ranking in Google’s Local Pack and for long-tail local keywords (e.g., “best estate agent Liverpool”, “emergency dentist near me London”).

## Benefits for UK Businesses
- **Enhanced Listings:** Show business hours, reviews, address, and phone in search results.
- **Local Pack Boost:** Get featured for “near me” and city-specific searches.
- **Voice Search:** Optimise for voice assistants (“find a plumber near me open now”).
- **Trust & Clicks:** Rich results increase trust and CTR.

## Step-by-Step: Adding Schema Markup

### 1. Choose the Right Schema Type
- Use [LocalBusiness](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) or a subtype (Restaurant, MedicalBusiness, Store).

### 2. Add JSON-LD Schema to Your Pages
Paste this example into your `<head>` or Next.js `<Head>` component:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Kreative Kommit",
  "image": "https://kreativekommit.com/assets/profile_img.jpg",
  "@id": "https://kreativekommit.com/",
  "url": "https://kreativekommit.com/",
  "telephone": "+44 1234 567890",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 High Street",
    "addressLocality": "London",
    "postalCode": "E1 1AA",
    "addressCountry": "GB"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 51.5074,
    "longitude": -0.1278
  },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.facebook.com/kreativekommit",
    "https://twitter.com/kreativekommit"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Validate Your Schema
- Use [Google’s Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
- Fix any errors and warnings.

### 4. Advanced Tips
- Add FAQPage schema for common questions.
- Use Review schema for testimonials.
- Update schema for each location/service.

## Case Study: Local Pack Success
A Liverpool estate agent added LocalBusiness schema and saw a 40% increase in Local Pack impressions and a 25% boost in calls.

## FAQs
**Q: Can I use schema for multiple locations?**
A: Yes, add separate LocalBusiness objects for each location.

**Q: Does schema guarantee rich results?**
A: No, but it greatly increases your chances.

## Action Steps
- Audit your site for schema opportunities.
- Implement and validate JSON-LD markup.
- Monitor results in Google Search Console.
