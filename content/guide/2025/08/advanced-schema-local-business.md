## 1. What is Schema Markup & Why Advanced Matters

**Schema markup** is structured data that helps Google and other search engines understand your website, products, and services. Advanced schema goes beyond the basics, unlocking:

- **Rich results** (stars, FAQs, business info, events)
- **Higher local rankings** for long-tail keywords
- **Automated SEO at scale** for hundreds of service/city pages

### Why Use Advanced Schema?
- **LocalBusiness subtypes** (Restaurant, MedicalBusiness, Store, etc.)
- **Service, Product, Offer, Review, FAQ, Event schemas** for maximum visibility
- **Automation**: Generate schema for every page using Next.js or your CMS


## 2. Advanced Schema Types for Local Businesses

### Step-by-Step: Implementing Each Schema Type

#### LocalBusiness Schema
1. Identify your business subtype (e.g., Restaurant, Store, MedicalBusiness).
2. Gather accurate business info: name, address, phone, opening hours, geo coordinates.
3. Use [Schema.org LocalBusiness documentation](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) for required and recommended properties.
4. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Kreative Kommit",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 High Street",
    "addressLocality": "London",
    "postalCode": "W1A 1AA",
    "addressCountry": "GB"
  },
  "telephone": "+44 1234 567890",
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": "51.5074",
    "longitude": "-0.1278"
  }
}
```

#### Service Schema
1. List all services you offer (e.g., "SEO Consulting", "Emergency Plumbing").
2. For each service, specify areaServed, serviceType, and provider.
3. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "SEO Consulting",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "name": "Kreative Kommit"
  },
  "areaServed": "London, Manchester, Birmingham"
}
```

#### Product & Offer Schema
1. For e-commerce or service packages, use Product and Offer schema.
2. Include price, availability, and itemCondition.
3. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Website Design Package",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "999.00",
    "priceCurrency": "GBP",
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
  }
}
```

#### Review & Rating Schema
1. Collect genuine customer reviews and ratings.
2. Mark up each review with author, datePublished, reviewBody, and ratingValue.
3. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Review",
  "author": "Jane Doe",
  "datePublished": "2025-07-01",
  "reviewBody": "Outstanding service!",
  "reviewRating": {
    "@type": "Rating",
    "ratingValue": "5"
  }
}
```

#### FAQ Schema
1. Identify common questions and answers about your business/services.
2. Use FAQPage schema for each Q&A pair.
3. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What areas do you serve?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We serve London, Manchester, and Birmingham."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Event Schema
1. For workshops, webinars, or local events, use Event schema.
2. Include event name, location, startDate, endDate, and offers.
3. Example JSON-LD:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Event",
  "name": "SEO Workshop London",
  "startDate": "2025-09-15T10:00",
  "endDate": "2025-09-15T16:00",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Kreative Kommit HQ",
    "address": "123 High Street, London, W1A 1AA"
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "49.00",
    "priceCurrency": "GBP"
  }
}
```

**Tip:** Use multiple schema types on a single page for maximum coverage. Validate with [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).

## 3. Automating Schema Markup in Next.js

Automate schema generation for every service/city page using your data sources. Example:

```typescript
import Head from 'next/head';

const schema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Kreative Kommit",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 High Street",
    "addressLocality": "London",
    "postalCode": "W1A 1AA",
    "addressCountry": "GB"
  },
  "telephone": "+44 1234 567890",
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": "120"
  },
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "datePublished": "2025-07-01",
      "reviewBody": "Outstanding service!"
    }
  ],
  "service": [
    {
      "@type": "Service",
      "name": "SEO Consulting",
      "areaServed": "London, Manchester, Birmingham"
    }
  ],
  "sameAs": [
    "https://facebook.com/kreativekommit",
    "https://twitter.com/kreativekommit"
  ]
};

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Head>
      <script type="application/ld+json">
        {JSON.stringify(schema)}
      </script>
    </Head>
  );
}
```

**Pro Tip:** Use server-side code to dynamically generate schema for every service/city combination. Automate updates for reviews, hours, and services.

## 8. Comprehensive FAQ: Schema & Local SEO

**Q: What is the difference between LocalBusiness and Service schema?**
A: LocalBusiness describes your business entity, while Service schema details each service you offer. Use both for maximum coverage.

**Q: How do I automate schema for hundreds of pages?**
A: Use server-side code (Next.js, Node.js, PHP) to generate JSON-LD dynamically from your database or CMS for each page.

**Q: What if Google Search Console shows schema errors?**
A: Use the Rich Results Test and Schema Markup Validator to debug. Fix missing or incorrect properties, and revalidate.

**Q: Can I use multiple schema types on one page?**
A: Yes! Combine LocalBusiness, Service, Review, FAQ, and Event schema for best results.

**Q: How often should I update my schema?**
A: Update whenever your business info, services, reviews, or events change. Automate updates if possible.

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Schema Issues

- **Error: Missing required property** – Check Schema.org docs for required fields.
- **Error: Invalid date format** – Use ISO 8601 (e.g., "2025-09-15T10:00").
- **Rich results not showing** – Ensure schema matches page content and is error-free. Results are not guaranteed.
- **Duplicate schema** – Avoid marking up the same entity multiple times on one page.

## 10. Glossary: Schema & SEO Terms
