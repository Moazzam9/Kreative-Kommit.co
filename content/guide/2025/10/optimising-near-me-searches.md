## What Are 'Near Me' Searches?
'Near me' searches are location-based queries where users look for services, shops, or professionals close to their current location (e.g., "plumber near me", "coffee shop near me"). In 2025, these searches are increasingly common on mobile devices and voice assistants, making local SEO more important than ever for UK businesses.

## Keyword Targeting for 'Near Me' SEO
