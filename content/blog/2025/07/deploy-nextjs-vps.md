# How to Deploy Next.js to a VPS: The Ultimate UK Guide for 2025

Deploying Next.js to a VPS gives you full control, speed, and SEO advantages. This guide covers every step, with advanced schema, actionable UK-specific tips, and expert troubleshooting.

## 1. Prepare Your Server

- Choose a UK-based VPS provider (e.g., Fasthosts, Krystal, OVH UK) for local speed and support.
- Update and secure your Ubuntu server:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  sudo apt install build-essential curl
  ```

- Set up a non-root user and SSH keys for secure access.

## 2. Deploy Your Next.js App

- Clone your repo and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone <your-repo-url>
  cd <project>
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

- Set environment variables for production (use `.env.production`).

## 3. Use PM2 for Process Management

- Install PM2 globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g pm2
  pm2 start npm --name "nextjs-app" -- start
  pm2 startup
  pm2 save
  ```

- Monitor and restart on failure: `pm2 logs`, `pm2 status`.

## 4. Configure nginx as a Reverse Proxy

- Install nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`
- Example config:

  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name yourdomain.com;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      }
  }
  ```

- Test and reload: `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx`

## 5. Secure Your Deployment

- Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
  sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
  ```

- Use strong passwords, SSH keys, and regular updates.
- Monitor with tools like UptimeRobot and fail2ban.

## 6. Advanced Schema & Local SEO

- Add LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema to homepage/contact:

  ```json
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "name": "Kreative Kommit",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "123 High Street",
      "addressLocality": "Liverpool",
      "postalCode": "L1 2AB",
      "addressCountry": "GB"
    },
    "telephone": "+44 1234 567890",
    "url": "https://kreativekommit.com/"
  }
  ```

- Optimise Google Business Profile and encourage reviews with city/service keywords.
- Use internal links to related guides and service pages.

## 7. Case Study: Liverpool Agency Success

A Liverpool agency switched to a UK VPS, implemented schema, and optimised GBP. Results: 30% more local traffic, 20% faster load times, and increased client enquiries.

## 8. FAQs

**Q: Can I deploy Next.js with Docker?**  
A: Yes, use a Dockerfile and docker-compose for containerised deployments.

**Q: How do I automate deployments?**  
A: Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD to build and deploy on push.

**Q: What if my app crashes?**  
A: PM2 restarts automatically; check logs for errors and optimise memory usage.

## 9. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- Use environment variables for secrets.
- Automate backups and monitor server health.
- Test performance with Lighthouse and WebPageTest.
- Stay GDPR compliant for UK users.

## 10. Action Steps

- Audit your server security and SEO signals.
