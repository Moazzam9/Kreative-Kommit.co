# Google’s October 2025 Core Update: What Changed and How to Respond


Google’s latest core update has the SEO world buzzing. Who’s up, who’s down, and what should you do next? Here’s your no-nonsense, jargon-free breakdown of what’s changed, who’s winning, who’s losing, and how to keep your UK business on top.

## What’s New in the October 2025 Core Update?

This update is all about quality, trust, and user experience. Google’s algorithm is now even better at:
- Surfacing original, in-depth content (no more copycat sites at the top)
- Rewarding sites with strong E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Prioritising fast, mobile-friendly, and accessible websites
- Penalising thin, outdated, or AI-spammy content

## Who’s Up? Who’s Down?

**Winners:**
- Sites with regularly updated, well-researched content
- Brands with clear author bios, trust signals, and real customer reviews
- Local businesses with strong Google Business Profiles

**Losers:**
- Sites relying on old, recycled, or generic content
- Pages overloaded with ads or pop-ups
- Businesses ignoring mobile and accessibility best practices

## How to Respond: Actionable Steps for UK Businesses

1. **Audit Your Content**
	- Update old posts, add new insights, and remove anything thin or outdated.
2. **Show Off Your Expertise**
	- Add author bios, credentials, and links to reputable sources.
3. **Boost Trust Signals**
	- Display reviews, awards, and clear contact info. Make your business look as real online as it is offline.
4. **Improve Site Speed & Mobile UX**
	- Compress images, fix slow pages, and make sure your site looks great on every device.
5. **Double Down on Local SEO**
	- Keep your Google Business Profile up to date and encourage happy customers to leave reviews.

## Pro Tips for Recovery (If You’ve Dropped)
- Don’t panic! Core updates are broad—wait a week or two before making drastic changes.
- Focus on quality, not quantity. One great post beats ten mediocre ones.
- Use Google Search Console to spot which pages lost traffic and why.

## Final Thoughts: Stay Ahead of the Curve

Google’s October 2025 core update is a wake-up call for anyone coasting on old tactics. Invest in quality, trust, and user experience, and you’ll not only survive this update—you’ll thrive in the next one, too.
