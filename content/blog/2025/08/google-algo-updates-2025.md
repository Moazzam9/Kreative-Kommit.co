# Google Search Algorithm Updates 2025: What UK Businesses Need to Know

## Major Changes in 2025
Google’s 2025 algorithm updates focus on user intent, local relevance, and mobile experience. Key changes include:
- Enhanced local ranking signals (proximity, reviews, schema)
- AI-driven content quality assessment
- Mobile-first indexing and page speed
- Voice search and conversational queries

## Impact on Local and National Rankings
- Local businesses with optimised Google Business Profiles, schema markup, and positive reviews see improved visibility.
- Sites with thin, duplicate, or outdated content may drop in rankings.
- Mobile-friendly, fast-loading sites are prioritised for both local and national searches.

## Actionable Steps for UK Businesses
1. Audit your site for mobile usability and speed.
2. Update and expand local service/city pages with long-tail keywords.
3. Implement LocalBusiness schema and FAQ markup.
4. Encourage and respond to Google reviews.
5. Monitor rankings and traffic in Google Search Console.
6. Regularly update content to reflect new services and trends.

## Conclusion
Staying ahead of Google’s algorithm updates is essential for UK businesses. Focus on local relevance, mobile optimisation, and high-quality content to maintain and grow your rankings in 2025.
