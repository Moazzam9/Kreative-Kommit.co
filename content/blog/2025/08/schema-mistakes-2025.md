# Schema Markup Mistakes to Avoid in 2025

## Why Schema Markup Matters for UK SEO
Schema markup helps Google understand your website, improves visibility in search results, and unlocks rich features like reviews, FAQs, and business details. In 2025, correct schema is essential for local businesses aiming to stand out in competitive UK markets.

## Common Errors in 2025
- Missing or incorrect LocalBusiness schema (e.g., wrong address or business type)
- Duplicate or conflicting structured data from plugins or manual edits
- Outdated business info (address, phone, opening hours)
- Failing to implement FAQ, review, or Service schema for key pages
- Using US spelling or terminology instead of British English
- Forgetting to test schema after site updates or redesigns

## Real-World Examples
- A Lancashire plumber lost rich results after a site redesign introduced duplicate LocalBusiness schema.
- A Leyland florist missed out on review stars by failing to add Review schema to their product pages.
- A Wigan electrician improved local rankings by updating their GBP and schema with accurate, geo-tagged business info.

## How to Diagnose and Fix
- Use Google’s Rich Results Test and Schema Markup Validator to check for errors
- Audit your site for missing, broken, or duplicate schema regularly
- Update business info and review schema whenever details change
- Remove duplicate or conflicting markup from plugins or manual code
- Customise schema for each service, city, and landing page

## Advanced Best Practices for UK Businesses

- Use British spelling and local terminology in schema fields
