# Ultimate Guide to Google Business Profile Optimisation for North West UK

## Why Google Business Profile Matters for North West Businesses
Google Business Profile (GBP) is the cornerstone of local SEO in the UK. For Leyland, Wigan, and North West businesses, a well-optimised GBP means higher visibility in Google Maps, the Local Pack, and more customer enquiries.

- **Fact:** Over 80% of UK consumers use Google to find local services. If your GBP isn‚Äôt optimised, you‚Äôre missing out.

## Step-by-Step GBP Optimisation
1. **Claim and Verify Your Profile**
   - Visit [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/) and claim your listing.
   - Use a local address and a verified phone number.
2. **Complete Every Section**
   - Add business hours, categories, services, and a detailed description using British spelling and local keywords (e.g., ‚ÄúLeyland plumber‚Äù, ‚ÄúWigan web designer‚Äù).
   - Use emojis sparingly for attention (e.g., üöÄ for ‚ÄúFast Response‚Äù).
3. **Add High-Quality Photos**
   - Upload professional images of your premises, team, and work. Geo-tag photos for extra local relevance.
   - Update photos regularly to show activity.
4. **Encourage and Respond to Reviews**
   - Ask happy customers to leave reviews mentioning your town and service (‚ÄúBest electrician in Wigan!‚Äù).
   - Always reply to reviews‚Äîthank positive ones, and address negatives politely.
   - Use clever review requests: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love your feedback‚Äîmention ‚ÄòLeyland‚Äô for a special thank you!‚Äù
5. **Use Posts and Updates**
   - Share offers, events, and news via GBP posts. Use local keywords and British spelling.
   - Pin important updates (e.g., holiday hours).
6. **Add Services and Products**
   - List all services/products with detailed descriptions. Include long-tail keywords for each location.
7. **Optimise for Mobile and Voice Search**
   - Ensure your GBP info matches your website and is easy to read on mobile.
   - Use conversational phrases for voice search (e.g., ‚ÄúFind a plumber near me in Leyland‚Äù).

## Clever Tactics for Extra Ranking Power
- **Geo-Tag Your Photos:** Use free tools to add location data to images before uploading.
- **Local Backlinks:** Link your GBP from local directories, council sites, and partner businesses.
- **Q&A Section:** Add and answer common questions (‚ÄúDo you offer emergency callouts in Wigan?‚Äù).
- **Use UTM Tracking:** Add UTM codes to your website link in GBP to track clicks in Google Analytics.
- **Leverage Attributes:** Add relevant attributes (e.g., ‚ÄúWheelchair accessible‚Äù, ‚ÄúFree Wi-Fi‚Äù) for extra visibility.
