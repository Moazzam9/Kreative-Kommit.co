# Video SEO & Short-Form Content: 2025 Playbook


Short-form video is the king of content in 2025—think TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. But how do you make sure your videos get seen (and not just by your mum)?

## Why Video SEO Matters

Google loves video, and so do users. Videos boost engagement, keep visitors on your site, and can land you in those shiny video carousels in search results.

## How to Optimise Video & Short-Form Content

1. **Use Catchy Titles & Descriptions**
	- Make them clear, fun, and keyword-rich.

2. **Add Captions & Transcripts**
	- Accessibility = bigger audience (and better SEO).

3. **Optimise Thumbnails**
	- Eye-catching images get more clicks.

4. **Embed Videos on Key Pages**
	- Don’t just post on social—add videos to your website, too.

## Pro Tips
- Use schema markup for videos
- Track performance in Google Search Console

## Final Thoughts: Lights, Camera, Rankings!

In 2025, video is your secret SEO weapon. Get creative, get visible, and let your content do the talking (and dancing).
