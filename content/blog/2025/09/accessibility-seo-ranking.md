# Accessibility as a Ranking Factor: 2025 Guide


Welcome to the wild world of SEO in 2025, where Google’s algorithms are smarter than your average goldfish (and probably smarter than your ex). But here’s the plot twist: accessibility isn’t just a “nice-to-have” anymore—it’s a full-blown ranking factor. Yep, making your site inclusive is now a power move for both humans and search engines.

## Why Accessibility Matters for SEO (and Humans)

Imagine you throw a party, but half your guests can’t get through the door. That’s what it’s like when your website isn’t accessible. Search engines notice, and so do users. Accessibility means everyone—regardless of ability—can enjoy your content, and Google loves that.

**Pro tip:** Accessible sites have lower bounce rates, longer visit times, and more happy visitors. That’s SEO gold.

## 2025’s Top Accessibility Moves for Better Rankings

1. **Alt Text is Your BFF**
	- Describe images like you’re texting a friend. “Dog in sunglasses at the beach” beats “IMG_1234.”

2. **Keyboard Navigation: Not Just for Hackers**
	- Make sure users can tab through your site. If they can’t, neither can Googlebot.

3. **Color Contrast: Fashion AND Function**
	- High contrast isn’t just stylish—it’s essential for readability. Use tools to check your palette.

4. **Semantic HTML: The Secret Sauce**
	- Use headings, lists, and landmarks. Screen readers (and search engines) eat this up.

5. **Descriptive Links: No More “Click Here”**
	- “Read our accessibility guide” > “Click here.”
