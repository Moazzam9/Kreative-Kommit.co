# Google Local Service Ads: The 2025 UK Playbook


If you haven’t heard of Google Local Service Ads (LSAs), you’re missing out on the hottest ticket for UK local businesses in 2025. Think of LSAs as your business’s VIP pass to the top of Google—right where your customers are searching.

## What Are LSAs?

LSAs are pay-per-lead ads that show up above regular search results. You only pay when a real customer contacts you. No more wasted ad spend!

## How to Win with LSAs

1. **Get Google Screened**
	- Pass Google’s background checks and show off your badge of trust.

2. **Optimise Your Profile**
	- Add photos, business hours, and glowing reviews. The more complete, the better.

3. **Respond Fast**
	- Speedy replies = happy customers (and better rankings in LSAs).

4. **Track Your Leads**
	- Use GA4 to see which ads bring in the best business.

## Pro Tips
- Ask every happy customer for a review
- Set a realistic budget and monitor results weekly

## Final Thoughts: Get in the Game

LSAs are changing the local marketing game in the UK. Get verified, get visible, and watch your business grow—no marketing degree required.
